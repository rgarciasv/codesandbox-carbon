Navigate the the [Githib Repo](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website), Let's use Carbon as an example.\n\n1. Create a new file using Github's UI in the location you are adding docs to.\nFor this example let's add this file to https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/master/src/pages/how-to-contribute\n\n1. Select \"Create New File\" in Github's UI. Add a title with a `.mdx` extension, and paste in your mdx code.\n\n1. Propose a new file. This will create a new branch on your Github account where you can further add images and update the nav-items.\nNavigate to your new branch, you can do this by clicking on Forks at the top of the PR screen, selecting your Github Account, and then using the Branch dropdown selecting your newly created branch.\n\n1. Add image files. In your new branch navigate to the file you created. \nSelect create new file and in the naming section type in `images/placeholder.md` this will create a new folder for images.\nYou can leave the placeholder file empty and select `commit to <branch name>`\nThis creates your images folder, you can now select `Upload files` and upload any images you are using.\nOnce the images are uploaded you can navigate back to the images folder, select `placeholder.md`, click the trash icon to delete, and select commit to branch.\n\n1. Lastly, we need to update the `nav-items.yaml` file so your new docs will show up on the site. Navigate to `/src/data/nav-items.yaml` in your branch\nand click the pencil icon to edit the file. Add your file into the navigation where you want it to show up and select commit to branch.\n\n1. Now that you've create your branch with the updated docs, without using the terminal, you can create a PR.\nFrom the repos home page select `New pull request`. This will create a PR to the source code.
